# UVIO: UWB-Aided Visual-Inertial Odometry Framework

This is the code of the [academic paper] An UWB-Aided Visual-Inertial Odometry Framework with
Bias-Compensated Anchors Initialization, a multi-sensor framework that leverages 
Ultra Wideband (UWB) technology and Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) to provide robust 
and low-drift localization. The whole project is built as an extension of OpenVINS.
